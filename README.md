# Offer Analysis & Classification Project

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of commercial offers made by a company. 

The study focuses on understanding the outcomes of these offers, particularly those that were **rejected**, either by **customers** or by the **company** itself.

The final goal of the project is to build a **classification model** that predicts whether a new offer is likely to be **accepted** or **rejected** based on historical data.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All company and user names have been anonymized to protect data privacy.
